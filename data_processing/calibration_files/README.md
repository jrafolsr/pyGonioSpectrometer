- 'IRF_FlameBlueFiber_wLens2945K.txt' : for the Arduino setup, F230SMA-A lens and assuming a blackbofy radiation from the H2000 lamp. Calibration factor of 7.10e6. TO BE UPDATED

- 'IRF_Flame2OrangeFiber_wLens-F260SMA-A+100um-slit_PMA12-reference.txt' : for the raspberry 1 setup (gonio2), taken with the new collimating lenses (F260SMA-A), orange fiber, the OceanOptics LS-1-CAL-1 and using the PMA12 lamp as a reference. Calibration factor of 6.08Ee6.

- 'IRF_Flame2OrangeFiber_wLens-F260SMA-A+100um-slit_PMA12-reference+LPVISE100a.txt' :  same as previous but multiplied by the spectral transimission of the polarizer, according to the datasheet. Calibration factor of xxx (to be adjusted).

- 'IRF_USB2000+ShortBlueFiber_wLens-F260SMA-A_PMA12-reference.txt' : for the raspberry 2 setup (gonio3), taken with the new collimating lenses (F260SMA-A), blue short fiber, the OceanOptics LS-1-CAL-1 and using the PMA12 lamp as a reference. Needs to be calibrated with the absolute calibration factor still.
